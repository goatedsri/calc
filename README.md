## installation and usage

### step 1: install `python3` and `git`

python download - https://www.python.org/downloads

git download - https://git-scm.com/downloads

### step 2: clone this repo - `goatedsri/calc`
> this will allow you to have a local copy of the codebase

```shell
# clones the github repository
git clone https://github.com/goatedsri/calc.git
```

### step 3: setup bash script `run.sh`
> this will give the necessary permissions to the bash script which will run the program

```shell
# sets the current working directory to our program
cd goatedsri/calc

#gives read/write/execute permissions to `./run.sh` by all users
chmod 777 ./run.sh
```

### step 4: run the cli help command
> this command will give you an idea of how the calculator cli works
